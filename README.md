Plot photos on Google Maps using GPS Exif data via FileReader API

### What is this?

PhotoGPS is a completely client-side web app that allows you to drag-n-drop 
your GPS-embedded photos and see them plotted on Google Maps! It doesn't require
that the photos be uploaded to any server, ensuring that your photos remain completely
secure and private, and this also greatly speeds up the processing time.
